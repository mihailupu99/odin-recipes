                Actually, the cooking liver wasn’t the horrible part. It
                actually smelled pretty good, and I started to hold out hope
                that maybe, just maybe, this would all end up tasting like pate.
                But then, like most things on this blog, my hopes were dashed
                spectacularly and thoroughly by one insane ingredient.

                This is two cups of French-cut canned green beans. Probably the
                most disgusting canned substance on earth besides skin-on
                bone-in canned salmon. (Tom’s note: I like canned green beans.
                In my single days I was known to eat them straight out of the
                can for dinner… ah, memories.)

                At this point, the smell coming off of this was horrendous. It
                smelled like rotten, vinegary liver. If you can even imagine
                that. Let’s just say you can’t even imagine how bad it smelled.I
                probably should have blended it longer. There were chunks. I
                remember tears actually forming in my eyes as an especially
                large chunk glopped out of the blender and fell into the mold. I
                really, really didn’t want to eat this.
