        <h2>Preparing steps</h2>
        <p>Ingredients</p>
        <ul>
            <li>¼ cup water</li>
            <li>¼ cup condensed tomato soup</li>
            <li>2 (¼ ounce) packets unflavored gelatin</li>
            <li>2 cans Spaghetti-Os</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Directions:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                In a large pot, pour in your water and condensed tomato soup,
                then sprinkle the gelatin on top. Allow gelatin to bloom in the
                water, about 5-10 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Once gelatin has bloomed, stir together lightly. Place the pot
                on the stove and turn the heat to medium, then keep stirring
                occasionally until the gelatin has completely dissolved, and the
                mixture is quite smooth. Turn off the heat and add the
                Spaghetti-Os to the pot. Mix until well-combined, then pour
                evenly into 4 cup ring mold.
            </li>
            <li>
                Refrigerate mold for 4 hours or overnight. When ready to serve,
                loosen mold by placing in a bowl of warm water, then invert onto
                a plate. Serve with Vienna sausages.
